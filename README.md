Verifies API key configuration and model settings.

## WebSocket Events

### Client to Server
- `start-voice-session`: Initialize new voice session
- `send-audio`: Send audio data to AI
- `send-text`: Send text message to AI
- `interrupt-ai`: Interrupt AI response
- `end-voice-session`: Terminate session

### Server to Client
- `voice-session-ready`: Session initialized successfully
- `audio-response`: AI audio response
- `text-response`: AI text response
- `turn-complete`: AI finished speaking
- `voice-error`: Error occurred

## Performance Optimizations

### Low Latency Features
- **Direct WebSocket Connection**: Eliminates HTTP overhead
- **Efficient Audio Encoding**: Optimized PCM format
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time audio playback
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections

### Resource Management
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of audio resources
- **Connection Limits**: Prevents server overload
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Microphone Not Working**
- Ensure browser permissions are granted
- Check microphone hardware and drivers
- Try refreshing the page

**High Latency**
- Check internet connection quality
- Verify server location and load
- Consider switching to development model

**API Rate Limits**
- Switch to development model for testing
- Monitor usage in Google AI Studio
